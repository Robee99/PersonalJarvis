# PyInstaller spec for the natively installed Personal Jarvis desktop app.
#
# Strategy:
# - `onedir` instead of `onefile` avoids 3-5 seconds of MEIPASS extraction and
#   allows each DLL to be signed independently.
# - TWO executables share ONE Analysis/COLLECT, because a native install has to
#   cover both surfaces the project promises:
#     * a windowed GUI launcher (Start Menu / Applications / .desktop), and
#     * a console CLI named `jarvis`, so `jarvis serve`, `jarvis --version`,
#       `jarvis missions list` behave exactly like the pip console script.
#   Both run `jarvis/__main__.py`; only the console flag differs.
# - The GUI binary is `PersonalJarvis`, not `Jarvis`: `Jarvis` and `jarvis`
#   are the SAME path on Windows (NTFS) and on a default macOS APFS volume, so
#   the second executable would overwrite the first. `PersonalJarvis` is the
#   name jarvis.core.branding already uses for the Windows branded launcher and
#   the macOS bundle executable.
# - Downloaded ML models are not bundled. The first-run wizard downloads them to
#   the platform-specific Jarvis model directory when the user enables them.
# - Optional native voice engines are loaded lazily and degrade to cloud paths
#   when unavailable. No Jarvis install profile requires torch or a GPU.
# - Excluding unused GUI frameworks saves roughly 500 MB.
#
# Invoke through the per-OS build script (packaging/<os>/build.*) or directly
# with `pyinstaller jarvis.spec --noconfirm --clean`.
