"""Mirror completed voice turns into the Jarvis agent-chat history.

Spoken and typed conversations reach the same assistant through different
stacks with different stores: a voice turn lands in ``sessions.db`` (and on
the voice stage's live transcript), a typed turn in ``agent_chat.db``. The
Jarvis agent card shows one of the two at a time (``Voice | Chat``), so a
spoken question and its spoken answer never appeared in the chat — switching
back from voice to chat showed nothing of what was just said.

This bridge closes that gap at the turn boundary, off the voice hot path
(AP-9): it subscribes to :class:`VoiceTurnCompleted` on the app bus and files
each turn's two texts into the newest ``jarvis``-surface chat session via
:meth:`AgentChatService.import_voice_turn` — no runner starts, nothing
re-answers, and a session that is busy typing keeps running. When the front
page bound a chat (``AgentChatService.bind_voice_chat``) the turn goes there
instead, and every turn of one call stays in the chat its first turn chose.
The imported turn also becomes context for the next typed turn, because the
API runner rebuilds its history from the same event log.

Only the lead's chat (surface ``jarvis``) is mirrored: the other society
agents have no microphone.
